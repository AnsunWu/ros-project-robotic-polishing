This \hyperlink{findNearestPoint_8h_source}{find\+Nearest\+Point.\+h} is a header file of finding the closest point on a post smoothing surface. There are three method in this class. The goal is to get indices array which indicate the closest point with several given points. For example, I can given a arbitrary coordinate and use this class to find a closest point ID from point cloud group.

This \hyperlink{findNearestPoint_8cpp}{find\+Nearest\+Point.\+cpp} is an implementation of finding the closest point on a post smoothing surface. There are three method in this class. The goal is to get indices array which indicate the closest point with several given points. For example, I can given a arbitrary coordinate and use this class to find a closest point ID from point cloud group.
